Proper listening equipment, coupled with the knowledge of normal and abnormal sounds, can yield reliable assessments of steam trap working condition.<BR><BR>Measuring the temperature of the steam trap is generally regarded as the least reliable of the three basic evaluation techniques since saturated steam and condensate coexist at the same temperature. The temperature downstream of a trap should drop off relatively quickly if the trap is working properly (mostly condensate immediately past the trap).

IPLV is the efficiency of an AC unit (usually a chiller) under various part-load conditions, i.e. various outdoor temperatures when the unit would operate at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of capacity.
